Scrape Slides
=============

Simple Node.js screen scraper that puts several results into a slide interface

Backlog/Ideas
----
- First page could be some sort of overview page with quick links to results
- Threading
- Style transformation for every source
- Sort order?
- Load/parse/convert PDF (docx? pdf2json?) instead of just <object>
- A pretty background image
- Add fields to sources: coordinates, homepages, other metadata...
- Sort by/make suggestions depending on keywords

Done
----
- ~~Caching~~
- ~~Add PDF support~~
- ~~Add support for locating PDF link if it's different every now and then (for example a restaurant with a different menu each week)~~
- ~~Templating~~
- ~~Maybe a simple navigation with one result per slide instead of a more complex column-based presentation (Reveal.js?)~~
